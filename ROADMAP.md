# Roadmap

If you want to know what features this project plans on implementing or want to know how you can get involved, please see the list below.

- Have CDIMapping handle a root node for the external representation.
- Change everything to use constants instead of strings (e.g. “mappedKeyValue”, “relatedByAttribute”).
- Have the mapping cache the mappings for the relationships.
- Discuss if the primary key should be required. If it should, then assert that it exists.
- Add tests for many-to-many relationship.
- [Someday] Implement a mapping for JSON API.

Don’t see the feature you want? Please feel free to open a GH issue to discuss adding it to the project.
