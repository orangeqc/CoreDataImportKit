# CoreDataImportKit

CoreDataImportKit (CDI) is a no frills, 100% Swift, CoreData importer. Easily define your mappings (i.e. how json data relates to your CoreData attributes) within your CoreData file (`*.xcdatamodeld`). No extra code needed.

There are no additional CoreData helpers. If you need that, check out [MagicalRecord](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord). 

The goal of CDI is to stay super lean and easy to maintain. CDI plans on being the _best_ framework written in Swift for implementing importing in your projects.

## Installation

It is recommended to add to your project via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Just add the following to your Podfile:

```txt
use_frameworks!

target `YourProject` do
    pod 'CoreDataImportKit'
end
```

## Usage

Inside of your `xcdatamodeld` file you'll need to define `relatedByAttribute` on your Entities's User Info. This should have the name of the attribute used to uniquely identify your entity. In a relational database this would be your primary key.

The default mapping from a dictionary (e.g. you api's json data) to your entity's attribute will be based on the attribute's name. If the two differ, then you can define `mappedKeyName`in the User Info of the attribute. This also applies to the relationships.

In order to run an import, you need two things: a mapping and an importer. Once youâ€™ve set that up, you just need to call `importRepresentation()` to import everything. Here is how you do it in Swift:

```swift
let mapping = CDIMapping(entityName: "Company", inManagedObjectContext: localContext)
let cdiImport = CDIImport(externalRepresentation: array, mapping: mapping, context: localContext)
cdiImport.importRepresentation()
```

In this example `array` is an array of dictionaries that each define a `Company`. That is all there is.

Optionally you can use the helper:

```swift
Company.cdiImportFromRepresentation(externalRepresentation: array, inContext: localContext)
```

Check out the wiki (soon) to learn more about the details. You can find out more about the representations and learn to create your own import strategy.

## Contributing

Think you have a way of making the importer faster? Have a way of making the code easier to understand? Want to help out with the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)? Please consider making a pull request.

If you want to discuss changes before writing the code, go ahead and create a Github issue to discuss the potential change. Changes are welcome, just make sure it is tested and that all existing tests continue to pass.
